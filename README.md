## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze bike-share data to uncover usage patterns and provide insights that can help improve user conversion strategies. The analysis focuses on understanding user behavior, identifying trends, and making data-driven recommendations.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project comes from the following sources:
- [Divvy Bike Share System Data](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)
- [City of Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)

## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies were used in this project:
- R studio
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- tidyr
- lubridate
- Tableau

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The data cleaning and preparation process involved the following steps:
1. Importing the data
2. Handling missing values
3. Removing duplicates
4. Converting data types
5. Creating new variables

## Analysis and Findings
The analysis focused on the following key areas:
- User demographics
- Trip duration and distance
- Popular routes and stations
- Peak usage times
- User conversion rates

### Key Findings
- The majority of users are annual members.
- Weekdays have higher usage compared to weekends.
- Morning and evening peak hours show the highest usage.
- Certain routes and stations are consistently popular among users.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into bike-share usage patterns and user behavior. The findings can be used to develop targeted marketing strategies and improve user conversion rates.

## Future Work
Future work could include:
- Analyzing seasonal trends
- Exploring the impact of weather on bike-share usage
- Implementing machine learning models to predict user behavior
